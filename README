This site is designed to be a more streamlined way of filling out and
storing of aquatic intake questionnaire forms. The current paper method
is outdated and has some failures when trying to collect, organize and store
completed intakes.

In the site you will be able to fill out the form. Once it has been
successfully submitted, an email will be sent notifying the aquatic team of a
new intake added to the system. The form will be stored, and will be
searchable allowing the team to find an intake easily when needed.

When accessing a logged questionnaire, the user will be able to search for an
intake using the client name, date of birth or their id number.

File intakes.sql is included to initialize the database.

The default connection to the database is made using mysql. inc/connection.php
contains the default settings to connect to the database.
