This site is designed to be a more streamlined way of filling out and
storing of aquatic intake questionnaire forms. The current paper method
is outdated and has some failures to organizing and storing associated with
it.

In the site you will be able to fill out the form. Once it has been
successfully submitted, an email will be sent notifying the therapist and the
form will be stored in a database for access at a later time.

When accessing a logged questionnaire, the user will be able to search using
the client name or their id number.
